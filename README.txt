This is the first computer science project we were
assigned in CSC148 this year (2018).

The goal of this program was to implement various algorithms for determining
how different elevators move. The program uses Python 3.7 and Pygame.

For example, the Pushy Passenger algorithm determines where the elevator should
go based on the target floor of the first passenger to board it, while the Random
Algorithm moves in a random direction every time.

Note: the visualizer.py and sprites.py were given to us
